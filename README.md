🛠 Troubleshooting Guide: Script Not Working? Try This!
If the script isn’t working as expected, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue:

🔍 Step 1: Use Incognito Mode
Incognito mode can help determine if cached data, cookies, or extensions are interfering with the script.

How to Open Incognito Mode:
Google Chrome: Press Ctrl + Shift + N (Cmd + Shift + N on Mac).
Firefox: Press Ctrl + Shift + P (Cmd + Shift + P on Mac).
Microsoft Edge: Press Ctrl + Shift + N.
Safari: Click File → New Private Window.
What to Do:
Open an incognito/private window in your browser.
Navigate to the page where you are experiencing the issue.
Test if the script works correctly.
💡 Why This Helps:
Incognito mode disables extensions and clears cookies, which can help pinpoint whether they’re causing the issue.

🔄 Step 2: Use a Different Account
If the issue persists in incognito mode, try using a different account.

How to Test with Another Account:
Sign out from your current account.
Sign in with a different account.
Revisit the page and test if the script works.
💡 Why This Helps:
Some issues may be related to account-specific settings, permissions, or restrictions.

🏥 Step 3: Seek Further Assistance
If the script still doesn’t work after trying the above steps, consider getting additional support.

Where to Ask for Help:
GreasyFork/Tampermonkey Comments – Provide details about what isn’t working.
Community Forums – Check for existing discussions or post your issue.
Platform Support – If the issue is with a specific website, check if they have restrictions or updates that might be blocking scripts.
Discord – The discord server linked at the top of the script is a great way of getting help for any errors that my occur.
⚠ Note: If seeking help in comments, please avoid leaving negative reviews just because the script isn’t working for you—many issues are browser or account-specific.
